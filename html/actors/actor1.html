          Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965) is an American actor. His
          career has been characterized by critical success in his youth,
          followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, and a
          surge in popular and commercial success later in his career. His films
          as a leading actor have grossed over $14 billion worldwide, making him
          one of the highest-grossing actors of all time. In 2008, Downey was
          named by Time magazine among the 100 most influential people in the
          world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's
          highest-paid actor.
